Work by Dumais \emph{et al.} \cite{dumais2000hierarchical} uses hierarchical structure to distinguish second level categories within the same class. However, they do not use second level categories as features or smoothing to predict other possible labels. Rennie \emph{et al.} \cite{rennie2003tackling} did a lot of work with dealing with prior probabilities on Naive Bayes classification, and using different values for their feature values and counts, such as in their TWCNB, but they do not consider using hierarchical data for Naive Bayes classification.
