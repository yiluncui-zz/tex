\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the
