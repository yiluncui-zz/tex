\section*{Abstract}

Relation prediction given the subject and the object is a new topic in Never Ending Language Learning project. Our prediction is based on a large amount of SVO tuple corpus. We predict the verb based on a Naive Bayes classifier. We propose strategies about stemming, prior and label sizes. We also propose a method to introduce category information into the Naive Bayes model.
Experiments results comparing these strategies show our category approach significantly improve the accuracy of the Naive Bayes model.
