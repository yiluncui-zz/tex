Relation prediction given the subject and the object is a new topic in the Never Ending Language Learning project. Our prediction mechanism uses large amounts of tuples from the \textbf{NELL SVO} corpus. We turned this task into a classification task having the verb as the label, and variants of the Naive Bayes classifier as our classification algorithm, all written in Map Reduce to accommodate for the data volume. We proposed strategies such as stemming, prior modifications. We also proposed a method to introduce categorical information into the Naive Bayes model via methods of smoothing. We evaluated our classifier and our techniques on different total possible labels. Experimental results comparing these strategies show our category approach significantly improve the accuracy of the Naive Bayes model.
